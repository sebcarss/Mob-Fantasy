story=\nWith a clap of Thunder the portal closes and the mist evaporates. The Five realise that they have been caught in a dastardly trap. Why on earth would a Dolhradrant demon, commonly used by Erhlitan Necromancers to bring them fresh dead bodies, be inside such a lovely chest with an open portal to a demonic realm? The Five decide to find a way out and to seek the answers from the mayor.  \n\nThe Five cannot use the original entrance as it is now blocked and there are no other ways out from where they are, however there are large rock faces that appear to lead up to platforms.\n
