# Mob-Fantasy

A text based RPG game to experience pair programming.

A game to give a group of people the experience of programming in a mob. This is a game that should be played with 5 people, non of whom need be developers. The point of this exercise is to allow people to get a feel for the benefits of pair programming through programming as a mob. 

You will need to create some handouts for the following cards, one for each of the players in the game. 

... TBC ...

## Rules

1. You are not allowed to show anyone else your card. 
2. You can communicate the knowlege held on your cards however you want, as long as it doesn't violate rule number 1.
3. The person who is dealt the driver card starts at the keyboard.
4. The driver plays for 3 minutes and then hands the keyboard to another player, and this continues until the game is complete.

Remember, the aim of mob programming (and pair programming) is to communicate your knowlege with your team mates to get to a resolution quickly and efficiently.
